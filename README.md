## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering represents a paradigm shift from traditional prompt engineering:

### Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering

**Prompt Engineering:**
- Focuses on clever wording and specific phrasing
- Limited to how you phrase a task
- Like giving someone a sticky note

**Context Engineering:**
- A complete system for providing comprehensive context
- Includes documentation, examples, rules, patterns, and validation
- Like writing a full screenplay with all the details

### Why Context Engineering Matters

1. **Reduces AI Failures**: Most agent failures aren't model failures - they're context failures
2. **Ensures Consistency**: AI follows your project patterns and conventions
3. **Enables Complex Features**: AI can handle multi-step implementations with proper context
4. **Self-Correcting**: Validation loops allow AI to fix its own mistakes

```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up Global Rules (CLAUDE.md)

The `CLAUDE.md` file contains project-wide rules that the AI assistant will follow in every conversation. The template includes:

- **Project awareness**: Reading planning docs, checking tasks
- **Code structure**: File size limits, module organization
- **Testing requirements**: Unit test patterns, coverage expectations
- **Style conventions**: Language preferences, formatting rules
- **Documentation standards**: Docstring formats, commenting practices

**You can use the provided template as-is or customize it for your project.**

### 2. Create Your Initial Feature Request

Edit `INITIAL.md` to describe what you want to build:

```markdown
## FEATURE:
[Describe what you want to build - be specific about functionality and requirements]

## PLATFORMS:
[iOS, Android, Web - specify which platforms you're targeting]

## EXAMPLES:
[List any example files in the examples/ folder and explain how they should be used]

## DOCUMENTATION:
[Include links to relevant documentation, APIs, or packages]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
[Mention any gotchas, specific requirements, or things AI assistants commonly miss]
```

**See `INITIAL_EXAMPLE.md` for a complete example.**

### 3. Working with PRPs

PRPs (Product Requirements Prompts) are comprehensive implementation blueprints that include:

- Complete context and documentation
- Implementation steps with validation
- Error handling patterns
- Test requirements

To use PRPs effectively:

1. **Create a PRP** using the template in `PRPs/templates/prp_base.md`
2. **Fill in all sections** with specific requirements for your feature
3. **Include relevant documentation** links and example references
4. **Define clear success criteria** and validation steps

### 4. Implementing Features with AI

When working with an AI coding assistant:

1. **Provide comprehensive context**:
   - Share CLAUDE.md for project rules
   - Include INITIAL.md or your PRP
   - Reference relevant example files
   - Share PLANNING.md for architecture understanding

2. **The AI will**:
   - Read all provided context
   - Follow established patterns
   - Implement features across Flutter and Node.js
   - Create tests alongside implementation
   - Validate work against success criteria

## Writing Effective INITIAL.md Files

### Key Sections Explained

**FEATURE**: Be specific and comprehensive
- ‚ùå "Build a chat feature"
- ‚úÖ "Build an async real-time chat with typing indicators, read receipts, image sharing, and offline support for iOS/Android/Web"

**PLATFORMS**: Specify target platforms
- iOS (minimum version)
- Android (minimum SDK)
- Web (browser requirements)

**EXAMPLES**: Leverage the examples/ folder
- Place relevant code patterns in `examples/`
- Reference specific files and patterns to follow
- Explain what aspects should be mimicked

**DOCUMENTATION**: Include all relevant resources
- Flutter package documentation
- Node.js/Express API documentation
- Database schema requirements
- Third-party service docs

**OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**: Capture important details
- Platform-specific differences
- Performance requirements
- Common pitfalls
- Security considerations

## The PRP Workflow

### Creating Effective PRPs

When creating a PRP:

1. **Research Phase**
   - Analyze your Flutter and Node.js codebase
   - Look for similar implementations
   - Identify conventions to follow

2. **Documentation Gathering**
   - Include relevant Flutter/Dart docs
   - Add Node.js/Express patterns
   - Reference package documentation

3. **Blueprint Creation**
   - Create step-by-step implementation plan
   - Include validation gates
   - Add test requirements

4. **Quality Check**
   - Ensure all context is included
   - Verify success criteria are measurable
   - Check that examples are referenced

### Using PRPs with AI

When providing a PRP to an AI assistant:

1. **Load Context**: Share the entire PRP document
2. **Planning**: AI creates detailed task list
3. **Execution**: AI implements each component
4. **Validation**: AI runs tests and linting
5. **Iteration**: AI fixes any issues found
6. **Completion**: AI ensures all requirements are met

## Using Examples Effectively

The `examples/` folder is **critical** for success. AI coding assistants perform much better when they can see patterns to follow.

### What to Include in Examples

#### Flutter Examples (`examples/flutter/`)
1. **API Service Pattern** - How you handle HTTP requests
2. **State Management** - Your chosen pattern (Provider/Riverpod/Bloc)
3. **Model Classes** - JSON serialization patterns
4. **Widget Structure** - How you organize UI components
5. **Navigation** - Routing patterns

#### Backend Examples (`examples/backend/`)
1. **Controller Pattern** - Express route handlers
2. **Service Layer** - Business logic organization
3. **Database Operations** - Prisma/Sequelize patterns
4. **Middleware** - Auth, validation, error handling
5. **API Response Format** - Consistent structure

### Example Structure

```
examples/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Explains what each example demonstrates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flutter/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api_service.dart       # HTTP client pattern
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth_provider.dart     # State management example
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_model.dart        # Data model pattern
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ home_screen.dart       # Screen structure pattern
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.controller.js     # Controller pattern
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user.service.js        # Service pattern
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.middleware.js     # Middleware pattern
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prisma.service.js      # Database pattern
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Explicit in INITIAL.md
- Don't assume the AI knows your preferences
- Include specific requirements and constraints
- Reference examples liberally
- Specify target platforms clearly

### 2. Provide Comprehensive Examples
- More examples = better implementations
- Show both what to do AND what not to do
- Include error handling patterns
- Show platform-specific code

### 3. Use Validation Gates
- PRPs include test commands that must pass
- AI will iterate until all validations succeed
- This ensures working code on first try

### 4. Platform Considerations
- Always specify which platforms (iOS/Android/Web)
- Include platform-specific requirements
- Note UI differences between platforms
- Test on all target platforms

### 5. Customize CLAUDE.md
- Add your Flutter conventions
- Include Node.js standards
- Define API patterns
- Specify testing requirements
